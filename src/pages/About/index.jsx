        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>
          I am George, a computer science student at the University of Applied Science and
          Arts Northwestern Switzerland, FHNW.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am studying computer science as I have always been very interested in computers, new 
          technologies and the digital revolution, their impact on all aspects of our lives both 
          now and in the future. This is what led me to an apprenticeship at UBS Bank as a 
          software developer where I gained inciteful, practical hands-on computing experience 
          alongside my high school studies and Matura exams. This in turn confirmed my passion for 
          computing and technical skills. I am now in the second year of the Batchelor’s degree 
          programme at FHNW.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy a competitive environment and I am always up for a challenge and an opportunity 
          to measure myself with others. At UBS, I was selected to be part of the masterclass 
          programme for young talented programmers. I also took part in the coding competition, 
          Swiss Skills, and, after succeeding in the regional heats, competed in the National 
          Finals. Twelve hours of computer programming tasks indeed challenged not only my skills 
          but my courage and stamina. My determination and curiosity also led me to Shanghai, 
          having been selected from my high school to take part in the “Route2China” program during 
          my apprenticeship. I received the opportunity to develop software in a “start-up” company 
          for four weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also been playing football for my local club since I was young. Now I am a trainer 
          for the same club helping teach, pass down the knowledge and further the next generation 
          of players. My passion for football continues and I learn a lot also from the fellow 
          trainers, participate in the club management meetings and step in as a referee sometimes
