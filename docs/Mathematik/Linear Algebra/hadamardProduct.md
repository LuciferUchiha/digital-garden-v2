The hadamard product is how some people might first think matrix multiplication works, which is wrong. 

The hadamard product is denoted using $\mathbf{A} \odot \mathbf{B}$ and is also commonly known as the element-wise matrix multiplication which perfectly describes how it works. It is defined for two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ of the same dimensions and results in another matrix $\mathbf{C}$ that has the same dimension as the two input matrices so $\mathbf{A, B, C} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$. So each element at $i,j$ in the resulting matrix is the product of the elements at $i,j$ of the two input matrices.

$$
\mathbf{A} \odot \mathbf{B}=\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix} \odot
\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} \\
    b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23} \\
    b_{31} & b_{32} & b_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}b_{11} & a_{12}b_{12} & a_{13}b_{13} \\
    a_{21}b_{21} & a_{22}b_{22} & a_{23}b_{23} \\
    a_{31}b_{31} & a_{32}b_{32} & a_{33}b_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

::: example

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 4 & 7 \\
    2 & 3 & 8 \\
    9 & 5 & 6 
\end{bmatrix} \odot
\begin{bmatrix}
    6 & 5 & 8 \\
    3 & 2 & 9 \\
    7 & 4 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    6 & 20 & 56 \\
    6 & 6 & 72 \\
    63 & 20 & 6 
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Beginners in numpy often write the following lines of code multiply two matrices


```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1,4,7],[2,3,8],[9,5,6]])
B = np.array([[6,5,8],[3,2,9],[7,4,1]])
A * B
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">




    array([[ 6, 20, 56],
           [ 6,  6, 72],
           [63, 20,  6]])



</CodeOutputBlock>

But as might notice this is the hadamard product/element-wise multiplication. You would get the same result if used the `np.multiply` function as this is the function that is called under the hood when using the `*` operator.
