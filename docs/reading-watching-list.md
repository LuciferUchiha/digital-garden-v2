This is a collection of articles, books and videos I have read or watched and would recommend to others. Most of them will be software development related but not necessarily. This is also a very useful lookup/bookmarking tool as I might remember that I've read something about a certain subject but not where.

### Books

- ["Effective C" by Robert C. Seacord](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C)<br/>
  I found this a good introduction and has some very good knowledge on C. I was a bit confused by the structure of the book especially the first few chapters but the content is great. You might also find it [here as a pdf](https://dokumen.pub/qdownload/effective-c-an-introduction-to-professional-c-programming-1nbsped-1718501048-9781718501041.html)
