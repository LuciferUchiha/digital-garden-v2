Arithmetic and logical operations are some of the key building blocks for writing any program as almost any functionality boils down to them.

In RISC-V all arithmetic operations have the same form, two sources (b and c) and one destination (a).

`add a, b, c`

This is in aid of the first design principle of RISC-V, "simplicity favors regularity".
