A Stack is like a pile of clothes or paper. Meaning it follows LIFO, last in first out. You can either push(put something on top) or pop(take something of the top). Often the operation peek/top is defined which returns the reference of the top element, so the next to be poped. A stack can be very easily implemented using a linked list. It can also be implemented using 2 Queues if you like to make life hard.
