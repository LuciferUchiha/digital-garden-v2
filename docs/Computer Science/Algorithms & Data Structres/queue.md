A Queue is as the name says like a queue of people. Meaning it follows FIFO, first in first out. You can either enqueue(add to the back) or dequeue(take from the front). Here the peek/element method returns the front element so the one to be next dequeued. A queue can also be very easily implemented using a linked list but it is also possible to do it with 2 Stacks.
