## Introduction

### Motivation

Image Classification problem, which is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories. many other seemingly distinct Computer Vision tasks (such as object detection, segmentation) can be reduced to image classification.

Example: image classification model takes a single image and assigns probabilities to 4 labels, {cat, dog, hat, mug}. an image is represented as one large 3-dimensional array of numbers.the cat image is 248 pixels wide, 400 pixels tall, and has three color channels Red,Green,Blue (or RGB for short). Therefore, the image consists of 248 x 400 x 3 numbers, or a total of 297,600 numbers. Each number is an integer that ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Our task is to turn this quarter of a million numbers into a single label, such as “cat”.

### Challenges

recognizing a visual concept (e.g. cat) is relatively trivial for a human to perform. keep in mind the raw representation of images as a 3-D array of brightness values:

- Viewpoint variation. A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.
- Scale variation. Visual classes often exhibit variation in their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image).
- Deformation. Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extreme ways.
- Occlusion. The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.
- Illumination conditions. The effects of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.
- Background clutter. The objects of interest may blend into their environment, making them hard to identify.
- Intra-class variation. The classes of interest can often be relatively broad, such as chair. There are many different types of these objects, each with their own appearance.

A good image classification model must be invariant to the cross product of all these variations, while simultaneously retaining sensitivity to the inter-class variations.

### Solution

Data-driven approach. Unlike writing an algorithm for, for example, sorting a list of numbers, it is not obvious how one might write an algorithm for identifying cats in images. provide the computer with many examples of each class and then develop learning algorithms that look at these examples and learn about the visual appearance of each class. This approach is referred to as a data-driven approach, since it relies on first accumulating a training dataset of labeled images.

The image classification pipeline:

- Input: Our input consists of a set of N images, each labeled with one of K different classes. We refer to this data as the training set.
- Learning: Our task is to use the training set to learn what every one of the classes looks like. We refer to this step as training a classifier, or learning a model.
- Evaluation: In the end, we evaluate the quality of the classifier by asking it to predict labels for a new set of images that it has never seen before. We will then compare the true labels of these images to the ones predicted by the classifier. Intuitively, we’re hoping that a lot of the predictions match up with the true answers (which we call the ground truth).
