## What is a digital garden?

A digital garden is a mix between a notebook and a blog, it is a place to share thoughts and cultivate them into garden. A blog has articles and a publication date and never changes after it has been published, whereas a digital garden is a place where the written notes keep getting edited and refined. The notes can span from just a short cheatsheet to a full set of notes on an entire subject where you go into every nitty gritty detail.

Another characteristic of a digital garden is the navigation: where a blog is usually explored in chronological order, a digital garden uses lots of internal links to connect all the notes together into a Network.

## How was my garden built?

My notes are written in Markdown. I used to write them in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but decided to move over to using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following plugins

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)
- [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint), which is also set as the formatter for `.md`

The reason for the switch is because my digital garden used to be built with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) however now it is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) which is in the end a react app and VS Code offers me other plugins to work on it.
