# Hangul

Hangul is the alphabetic used for writing in South Korea. It consists of 24 letters, 14 of which are consonants and the other 10 letters are vowels. This consonants and vowels can be combined to create syllables.

## Consonants

These are the 14 consonants used in korean. Important to note here is that "ieung" is like the neutral element in maths, it doesn't have a pronunciation.

Some ways to remember the symbols and their pronunciation.

## Vowels

There are two ways the vowel can be combined with a consonant. It can either be written to the right of it or underneath it. The ones that are written to the right are all based of a vertical line. The ones that are written underneath are based of a horizontal line.

Another good trick to remember the vowels is that if there are 2 lines apart from the base line then it is a "y" + the vowel if one line was taken away.
