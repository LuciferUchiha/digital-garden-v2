# Introduction

## History

C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 to construct utilities running on Unix later on it was also used to re-implement the kernel of the Unix operating system and has till this day been the kernel language for Unix. In 1989 C was standardized by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) to so called ANSI C or also known as C89. Later on in the same year it was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) who then created the so called Standard C. Over the years ISO has published new standards corresponding to the year they were published in, so C90, C99, C11, C17 and are now working on C2x.

## Running a C program

4 phase when programming:

- editing
- compiling(2 phases: preprocessing where code can be modified, compilation syntax and semantic checks is checked. Then translated to assembly language which the compiler then translates into actual machine code/instructions which is stored in object files (.obj or .o))
- linking(goal is to get the program into a final form for execution on the compute, this is most of the time done during compilation, the linker combines the object modules with additional libraries needed by the program to create the entire executable file which can then be run)
- running

### Installing C compiler on Windows

GNU gcc compiler, make and gdb debugger cygwin.com which simulates a unix environment.
