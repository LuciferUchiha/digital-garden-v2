# Introduction

## History

C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 to construct utilities running on Unix later on it was also used to re-implement the kernel of the Unix operating system and has till this day been the kernel language for Unix. In 1989 C was standardized by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) to so called ANSI C or also known as C89. Later on in the same year it was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) who then created the so called Standard C. Over the years ISO has published new standards corresponding to the year they were published in, so C90, C99, C11, C17 and are now working on C2x.
